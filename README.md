The Odin Project Rock, Paper, Scissors Assignment

This project helped me learn better:
1) DOM and DOM manipulation
2) Selecting and Manipulating Elements
3) Handling Click Events
4) Implementing Game Logic
5) Manipulating CSS Styles

This project still needs the following improvements:
1) The computer choice to be made hidden at game start
2) A working counter to be added for draws
3) Fixing the game loginc on the replay button
4) Fixing the submit button to prevent repeat submissions before game reset
5) styling
