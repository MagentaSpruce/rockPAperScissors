Odin Project JS Assignment

This project helped me to learn better:
1) DOM and DOM manipulation
2) Selecting and manipulating elements
3) Handling click events
4) Implementing game logic
5) Implementing CSS Styles


This project still needs to have corrected the following:
1) The computer choice hidden upon game start
2) A working counter for the "draw" scenario
3) The game logic to be fixed for the replay button when a game is lost
4) Prevent multiple guesses before reset
5) Styling
